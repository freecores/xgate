This is a fragment of code I wrote many years ago while waiting on some long
synthesis and place and route runs to complete. It converts srecord files
into a format that is ready for the "readmem" Verilog command. I don't
believe that it calculates and checks srecord parity. It should compile with
a simple command line entry.
